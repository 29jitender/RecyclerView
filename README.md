Simple list using recylerView and cardView 

RecyclerView and CardView were introduced in Android L Developer Preview.
RecyclerView:

RecyclerView is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView. This widget is a container for large sets of views that can be recycled and scrolled very efficiently. Use the RecyclerView widget when you have lists with elements that change dynamically.

CardView:

CardView extends the FrameLayout class and lets you show information inside cards that have a consistent look on any app. CardView widgets can have shadows and rounded corners.
